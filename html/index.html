      <p>I am a beginner front end programmer.</p>
      <h3>My goal:</h3>
      <p>In a short time to gain experience and skills for developing web applications.</p>
      <h3 a name="skills">My skills:</h3>
      <p>In the future, I plan to become a full stack developer in the front end.</p>
      <p>I read several books on developing web applications and successfully applied the knowledge from this book in personal projects.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, I have no experience in real projects. But I hope that as a result of taking courses at RS School I will have a good portfolio with small projects for the future employer.</p>
      <p>I have no programming experience. But I have a higher technical education at BNTU and have a great deal of experience in my work.</p>
      <p>My English remained at the school level, but communication at a simple level is available to me.</p>
