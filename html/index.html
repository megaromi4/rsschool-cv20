Resume
My name is Ryabtsev Roman .
My phone number: +375447434675
I am a beginner front end programmer.

My goal:
In a short time to gain experience and skills for developing web applications.

In the future, I plan to become a full stack developer in the front end.

I read several books on developing web applications and successfully applied the knowledge from this book in personal projects.

Unfortunately, I have no experience in real projects. But I hope that as a result of taking courses at RS School I will have a good portfolio with small projects for the future employer.
I have no programming experience. But I have a higher technical education at BNTU and have a great deal of experience in my work.
My English remained at the school level, but communication at a simple level is available to me.
